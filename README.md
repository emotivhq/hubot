# Giftbot

Giftbot is a chat bot, modeled after GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty
cool. He's [extendable with scripts](https://github.com/hubot-scripts) and can work on [many
different chat services](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/).

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that we
use for building our own bots.  See the [documentation](http://hubot.github.com/docs)
for details on our very own robot friend, Giftbot (aka Ethan aka Daisy).

In most cases, you'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you
are building your own bot. But if you do, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you'd like to chat, drop by [#hubot](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#hubot) on FreeNode IRC.
