`Hubot` (prounounced *hew-bot*) is a smart bot, modeled after GitHub's Campfire bot, `hubot`. He's pretty
cool. He's [extendable with scripts](https://github.com/hubot-scripts) and can work with [many
different services](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/).

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that we
use for building our own bot adapters.  See the [documentation](http://hubot.github.com/docs)
for details on our very own robot friend, `Hubot` (aka `ethan` aka `daisy` aka `eva` aka `#chaboi`).

In most cases, you'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you
are building your own bot. But if you do, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
